"ABSTRACT"
"Lower limb amputations are the most common level of amputation. Mobilization of patients with lower limb amputations is an important"
"rehabilitation goal. It is critical to prescribe the most appropriate prosthesis for the patient to achieve the rehabilitation goal in lower"
"extremity amputations. Appropriate prosthesis prescription in lower extremity amputations is based on the selection of the correct"
"prosthetic parts. The choice of prosthesis should be based on the patient's activity level and potential. The prosthesis decision should be"
"made by a team, particularly with the participation of the patient."
