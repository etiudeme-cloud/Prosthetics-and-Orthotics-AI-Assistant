"Preface"
"Prostheses (artificial legs and hands) and orthoses (braces and splints) enable people with"
"physical impairments or functional limitations to live healthy, productive, independent,"
"dignified lives and to participate in education, the labour market and social life. The use of"
"prostheses or orthoses can reduce the need for formal health care, support services, long-"
"term care and caregivers. Without access to prostheses or orthoses, people who need them"
"are often excluded, isolated and locked into poverty, which increases the burden of morbidity"
"and disability."
""
"The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) states that Member"
"States are responsible for taking effective measures to ensure personal mobility for the"
"greatest possible independence of people with disabilities. They also have a corresponding"
"responsibility to promote and ensure the availability of and access to mobility aids, devices"
"and assistive technologies, including prostheses and orthoses. Since 2006, more than 170"
"countries have ratified the CRPD and are therefore obliged to ensure access to affordable,"
"high-quality assistive products, including prostheses and orthoses."
""
"WHO estimates that, today, only 1 in 10 people in need has access to assistive products,"
"including prostheses and orthoses, because of their high cost and because of lack of"
"awareness, availability, trained personnel, policy and financing. Hence, WHO is coordinating"
"a global initiative, “Global cooperation on assistive technology” (GATE), to improve access to"
"high-quality, affordable assistive products. WHO’s global disability action plan for 2014–2021"
"and the subsequent publication Rehabilitation in health systems request Member States to"
"develop financing and procurement policies to ensure that assistive products, including"
"prostheses and orthoses, are available to everyone who needs them."
""
"To improve access to prosthetics and orthotics services, WHO, in partnership with the"
"International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics (ISPO) and the United States Agency for"
"International Development (USAID), has prepared global standards and an implementation"
"manual to assist Member States in setting up, improving or transforming their systems for"
"delivering these services. One aim of the document is to ensure that prosthetics and orthotics"
"services are integrated into health services and systems, as they are often provided at the"
"same time as other health services. WHO believes that this document will promote greater"
"access to these services globally, as another step towards strengthening universal health"
"coverage and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

"Executive summary"
"This document provides a set of standards and a manual for implementation to support"
"countries in developing or improving high-quality, affordable prosthetics and orthotics"
"services. It brings promise, by ensuring that everyone in need, everywhere, has access to"
"prostheses and orthoses: that no one is left behind. Its aim is to ensure that prosthetics"
"and orthotics services are people-centred and responsive to every individual’s personal and"
"environmental needs."
""
"Implementation of these standards will support Member States in fulfilling their obligations"

"This document has two parts: the standards and an implementation manual. Both parts"

"The Introduction outlines the scope and purpose of the document and describes the"
"importance of ensuring access to prosthetics and orthotics services for people with physical"
"impairments or functional limitations in order to respect their human rights and allow"
"them to achieve mobility and dexterity and participate in society. According to the CRPD,"
"facilitating the access of people with disabilities to mobility aids and assistive devices and"
"technologies is a State obligation (8). The section also recalls that only 5–15% of those who"
"could benefit from assistive products, including prostheses and orthoses, have access (13)."
"Critical challenges in developing prosthetics and orthotics services are identified, such as"
"lack of dedicated policies and national strategic plans; a general lack of understanding about"
"the role, purpose and benefits of these services; limited funding; and the relatively high cost"
"of service delivery."
""
"Part 1. Standards for prosthetics and orthotics"
"Area 1. Policy points out the responsibility of Member States to promote the availability and"
"use of prostheses and orthoses at a cost that is affordable to users or the State. It recalls that"
"governments should assume a leading role in or delegate responsibility for the governance"
"of nationwide prosthetics and orthotics services and should involve a range of stakeholders"
"in planning, developing and monitoring services. A guiding framework, consisting of legal"
"acts, policies, strategic plans, standards, rules and regulations, should be in place to guide the"

"design of affordable, accessible, effective, efficient, safe services of high quality. The section"
"states that funding of prosthetics and orthotics services must be included in moving towards"
"universal health coverage. Access to prostheses and orthoses can be greatly increased"
"by appropriate financing, especially through national health and/or social insurance. The"
"argument is made that money spent on these services is not an expense but an investment"
"that generates both social and economic returns."
""
"Area 2. Products emphasizes that prosthetic and orthotic products and working methods"
"should be appropriate to the setting in which the products are fabricated, fitted, used and"
"funded. Establishment of a national list of priority products helps to create public awareness,"
"mobilize resources, guide product development and procurement and stimulate competition"
"to make the products available at an affordable cost. The section proposes that prosthetic"
"and orthotic materials and components and the tools, machines and equipment used in"
"the services be exempt from import taxes and customs fees in order to ensure that they"
"are affordable and accessible. It urges national and international stakeholders, including the"
"private prosthetics and orthotics industry, to develop alternative, affordable products made"
"of cost–effective, good-quality, context-appropriate components."
""
"Area 3. Personnel identifies the requirements to be considered in planning, developing"
"and promoting professional recognition of the workforce. It stresses the importance of"
"training various types of prosthetics and orthotics personnel to meet nationwide demand"
"and urges the promulgation of State regulations to ensure that service users are protected"
"from malpractice and poor-quality services. Prosthetics and orthotics clinicians should be"
"recognized as independent health professionals with a distinct professional title, profile and"
"job description. The section states the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach in"
"prosthetics and orthotics, especially for people with severe or complex physical impairments."
""
"Area 4. Provision of services emphasizes the importance of people- or user-centred"
"prosthetics and orthotics services. Users must be regarded as equal members of the"
"treatment team and be given the necessary information to empower them to make decisions"
"about their care and final selection of a product. They should be consulted and involved in"
"policy development and in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating services. The"
"section positions prosthetics and orthotics services as an integral part of health services,"
"closely related to medical, surgical and rehabilitation services. It raises the importance of"
"coordination with other sectors, such as labour, social welfare and education, for overall health"
"and rehabilitation outcomes. The section outlines standards for referral, service delivery and"
"service unit management."
""
"The section entitled “The way forward” states that implementing the standards should"
"involve various stakeholders. Eight steps are identified in setting up or improving a national"
"prosthetics and orthotics service and implementing the standards. The section recommends"
"that Member States adapt the 60 standards to suit their contexts, giving priority to those"
"that must be implemented to safeguard users’ rights and safety and to ensure quality and"
"performance. In countries with limited resources, particularly those requiring technical"

"and research questions and urges international support for Member States to generate more"
"evidence to promote the prosthetics and orthotics sector globally."

"Part 2. Implementation manual"
"The structure of the implementation manual is similar to that of Part 1 on standards but"
"provides details to assist policy-makers and health care programme managers, particularly"
"of rehabilitation services, in planning, implementing, managing and further developing"
"prosthetics and orthotics services to meet the standards. It elaborates on the standards,"
"describing “what, why, how, who and when”."
""
"The manual can be used as a reference document and to stimulate discussion at national"
"and service delivery levels during the development of strategic plans, tools and methods"
"for strengthening prosthetics and orthotics service delivery, area-by-area, as necessary in"
"each context. This will ensure that users of prosthetics and orthotics receive the best-quality"
"services and products, contributing to the overall aim of optimal functioning, full participation"

"About this document"
"Purpose"
"Part 1 of this document presents a set of standards for countries to use in developing or"
"strengthening essential, affordable, accessible, effective, efficient, safe prosthetics and"
"orthotics services of high quality. Part 2 of the document is a manual for operationalizing"
"the standards."
""
"The standards are aligned with the United Nations CRPD (8). Adoption of these standards will"
"support governments in fulfilling their obligation to implement the CRPD and in meeting the"
"SDGs, in particular Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (12)."
"Using these standards, any government can develop national policies, plans and programmes"
"for the highest standard of provision of prosthetics and orthotics services."
""
"Aims"
"• Support countries in implementing objective two of the WHO Global disability action plan"
"2014–2021 (14), to strengthen and extend rehabilitation, habilitation, assistive products,"
"support services and community-based rehabilitation (14, 15)."
"• Support stakeholders in their work to achieve the eight recommended areas of rehabilitation"
"in health systems and the subsequent Rehabilitation 2030: Call for action for coordinated,"
"concerted global action towards strengthening rehabilitation in health systems (16)."
"• Contribute to achieving the goal of WHO’s GATE initiative (see Box 1), which is to improve"
"access to high-quality, affordable assistive products globally (17–19)."
"• Contribute to realizing universal health coverage to ensure that all people can use the"
"promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, assistive and palliative health services they"
"need, which are of sufficient quality to be effective, and also ensuring that use of these"
"services does not impose financial hardship on the user (11)."
"• Support countries in implementing the CRPD, in particular Article 20 (Personal mobility),"
"which includes facilitating access to high-quality mobility aids, devices and assistive"
"technologies, and Article 26 (Habilitation and rehabilitation), which calls for the"
"organization, strengthening and extension of comprehensive habilitation and rehabilitation"
"services and programmes (8)."

"Box 1. Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology (GATE)"
""
"The aim of WHO’s GATE initiative is to remove barriers to inclusion and participation in society by"
"improving the availability and affordability of assistive products, including prostheses and orthoses,"
"for everyone, everywhere."
"Today, only 5–15% of the population in need has access to assistive products (20), i.e. products"
"for people with impaired mobility, sight, hearing, speech or cognition. Without access to such"
"products, many individuals in need are confined to their homes and live dependent, excluded lives,"
"increasing the impact of the impairment and disability on the person, family and society. The GATE"
"initiative is designed to address this huge unmet need and to realize Article 20 (Personal mobility)"
"and Article 32 (International cooperation) of the CRPD (8)."
"To achieve its main objective, GATE recently published a list of priority assistive products (2), on"
"which prostheses and orthoses are identified as essential."
""
""
""
""
"Scope"
"The document covers the services provided by prosthetics and orthotics personnel,"
"particularly prosthetists and orthotists. Certain types of orthosis may be provided by"
"other health care professionals who have the right skills, such as physicians, nurses,"
"physiotherapists, occupational therapists, pedorthotists, pedorthists and podiatrists. Where"
"relevant, the standards should also apply to services provided by these professionals. Internal"
"prostheses, such as joint replacement implants and dental prostheses, are not covered."
""
"To guide Member States in improving access to prostheses and orthoses, the document"
"presents 60 standards that need to be in place to safeguard user rights, safety, quality and"
"performance of service systems and products. The standards defined are global and are"
"neither country-specific nor exhaustive. Countries can prepare more detailed standards"
"in all the areas covered, particularly for technical work in service delivery. National and"
"international stakeholders in prosthetics and orthotics are encouraged to use this document"
"in cooperating and collaborating in the development of technical resources."
""
"People-centred care"
"This document places the prosthetics and orthotics service user at the centre of the"
"establishment, development and maintenance of services of the highest possible quality. It"
"promotes services that are responsive, effective and efficient and can maximize the number"
"of people assisted. People-centred care strengthens personal identity, leading to enhanced"
"well-being. Social interactions with family, friends and the community and educational and"
"health care are all important. Such support helps people to flourish and participate in activities"
"that contribute to an optimum quality of both personal and social life (Fig. 1)."

"Declarations of interests"
"The management of conflicts of interest was a key priority throughout the development"
"process of these standards. The competing interests that may occur in health care result in"
"the potential for conflicts of interest and may lead to biased generation or assessment of"
"evidence and to misinformed health care policies. WHO has stringent policies for avoiding"

"trust and transparency in connection with WHO meetings or products involving the provision"
"of technical/normative advice, the names and brief biographies of individuals of the Standards"
"Development Group were published on the WHO website for public notice and comment (25)."
"After analysis of each declaration of interest, it was concluded that there were no conflicts"
"of interest that would exclude any individual from participating in the development process."

"Two lead authors were selected following the WHO Request for Proposals bidding process."
"The process of Declaration of Conflict of Interests was appropriately followed. Author one,"
"Anders Eklund, previously worked for WHO and currently serves as a freelance consultant."
"Sandra Sexton, previously director of the National Centre for Prosthetics and Orthotics,"
"University of Strathclyde, and then grant manager of ISPO served as second author. WHO"
"colleagues involved in the development process of these standards were also deemed not"
"to have any direct conflict of interest."
""
"Implementation of standards"
"The 60 standards presented in this document are intended to stimulate Member States to"
"establish and maintain appropriate systems and infrastructure for the provision of high-quality"
"prosthetics and orthotics services. This depends on the financial, human and other resources"
"that can be mobilized in each country; some will find implementation more challenging than"
"others, and, in many cases, full implementation will take longer. Nevertheless, although each"
"standard may not immediately be realized, it will serve as a goal to be reached and a guide"
"to setting benchmarks and finding resources to achieve the goal. All Member States are"
"expected to take gradual steps towards full implementation."
""
"Effective implementation of the standards requires joint action among all relevant national"
"stakeholders, including users and their representatives or organizations, government"
"ministries, service providers, nongovernmental and professional organizations and donor"
"agencies."
"xx"
"It is suggested that implementation of the standards follow four steps:"
"Step 1: Compare national prosthetics and orthotics systems and services with the complete"
"set of standards (Annex 1) to derive a baseline against which to monitor future"
"developments."
"Step 2: Identify priorities for action, guided by Part 2 of this document."
"Step 3: Prepare a 5–10-year national strategic plan, with clear benchmarks for implementation"
"in each area (policy, products, personnel and provision of services)."
"Step 4: Conduct annual and mid-term evaluations by comparisons with the benchmarks to"
"determine progress, and update the plan as needed."

"in an instant: a happy family was immediately labelled a “cursed” family. Household expenditure"
"soared in the search for a possible cure or at least rehabilitation. Their parents stayed firm against"
"the stigma and prejudices and decided that their children would be educated like other children."
"Getting children with disabilities into a regular school was not easy at that time, and so they went"
"to a school run by the Association of People with Disabilities in Bangalore. There, they had their"
"first experience of physiotherapy and orthoses,"
"which consisted of heavy metal braces with"
"black boots. They were happy at the school,"
"but it went only up to 7th grade. To continue"
"their education, they went to a regular school,"
"where the environment was hostile. They"
"quickly learnt tricks to cope with the attitudinal"
"barriers and also with the inaccessible physical"
"environment, especially toilets. Minds of steel,"

"Prosthetics and orthotics"
"Prosthetics is a specialty within the medical and health care field concerned with the research"
"and development, design, manufacture and application of prostheses. Similarly, orthotics is a"
"discipline concerned with orthoses. Prosthetics and orthotics often comprise similar steps in"
"service delivery and similar tools, equipment and working methods and are therefore usually"
"taught, promoted and practised together. “Prosthetics and orthotics” is the umbrella term"
"for the science, technology, education and application of prostheses and orthoses."
""
"Prosthetics and orthotics services"
"“Prosthetics and orthotics services” is an umbrella term for the combination of inputs, such"
"as policy (financing), products (components and material), personnel, required to deliver the"
"appropriate prostheses, orthoses and related therapy (26). As in any health service, improving"
"access to and the coverage and quality of prosthetics and orthotics services depends on the"
"availability of resources, the organization and management of services."
""
"Prosthetics and orthotics services provide comprehensive care with preventive, promotive,"
"assistive and rehabilitative interventions. They usually involve assessment of potential users"
"and a treatment plan, including the design, manufacture, fitting and delivery of prostheses"
"and orthoses."
""
"Prosthetics and orthotics services within health care"
"Prosthetics and orthotics services are part of health care and are often included in rehabilitation"
"services. Like other health services, their aim is to optimize users’ health and well-being. The"
"interventions are usually part of the health care continuum, such as providing therapeutic"
"or protective footwear in the treatment of a diabetic or neuropathic foot, fitting a prosthesis"
"after amputation or provision of an orthosis to support a paralysed limb after a stroke. Timely"
"prosthetics and orthotics service provision is important to restore functioning and to prevent"
"secondary deformities."
""
"With other interventions, such as education, skills training, job coaching, placement and"
"social support, prosthetics, orthotics and rehabilitation services contribute towards the"
"overall aim of optimal functioning and hence full participation and inclusion in society. All"
"interventions are important to achieve this goal (Fig. 5)."

"Users"
"Users of prosthetics and orthotics services are people in all walks of life who have physical"
"impairments or functional limitations, due, for example, to:"
"• noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, stroke, cancer and peripheral vascular disease;"
"• communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and Buruli ulcers;"
"• injuries due to falls, road traffic and industrial accidents, natural disasters, war and conflicts;"
"• degenerative changes in the spine, hip, knee, foot, ankle or upper limbs;"
"• congenital anomalies or limb deficiencies; and"
"• cerebral palsy."
""
"Most users have long-term chronic health conditions, such as limb amputation, limb"
"paralysis, spinal cord injury or structural deformities, and therefore a lifelong need for health"
"care, including prosthetics and orthotics. Others may require medium-term provision, such"
"as in the management of adolescent scoliosis until bone maturity, or short-term provision,"
"for example to support healing after a traumatic injury or fracture."
""
"Many users require a continuum of care that evolves during their lifetime. Prostheses and"
"orthoses must be repaired, adjusted, modified and replaced at intervals that depend on"
"environmental factors, user activity and physiological changes. A 10-year-old child whose"
"lower limb was amputated, for example, is likely to require 25–30 prostheses over the course"
"of their life (26). Service users should have the right to be treated by the same clinician for a"
"substantial part of their life (when possible), because of the complex psychosocial, physical"
"and technical provider–user relationship."

"Numbers required"
"Although the need for prosthetics and orthotics services can be assessed in various ways (see"
"1N of Part 2), precise, reliable figures are frequently not available for countries. It has been"
"estimated, however, that 0.5% of any population globally requires prostheses and orthoses"
"and rehabilitation treatment (24). This estimate does not take into account local factors that"
"may result in more impairments (such as conflict, many traffic injuries, highly prevalent"
"disease) or fewer (due, for example, to successful prevention of accidents or good trauma"
"care). Nevertheless, it gives an idea of the challenge countries are facing. The estimate of"
"0.5% of the world population would correspond to 35–40 million people globally who require"
"prosthetics and orthotics services. At least two to four times more people attend services"
"for orthotic treatment than for prosthetic treatment (27)."
""
"Over the next few decades, the number of people requiring prosthetics and orthotics"
"services is bound to rise because both the world’s population and life expectancy are"
"growing. As a larger proportion of the ageing population will be affected by disability (28),"
"the need for services will rise proportionally. The world is witnessing significant increases"
"in musculoskeletal conditions (29) and noncommunicable diseases (30) such as diabetes (31,"
"32) (see example in Box 3) and stroke (33, 34), which, if they continue, will greatly add to the"
"need for prosthetics and orthotics. Thus, by the middle of this century, the proportion of the"
"world’s population that requires services is likely to be closer to 1%."
""
""
"Box 3. The increase in noncommunicable diseases: diabetes"
""
"An estimated 415 million people were reported to have diabetes in 2015, and this figure is"
"expected to rise to 642 million in 2040 (32). As 60–70% of people with diabetes lose sensation"
"in their feet, they are at risk for injury. Furthermore, 12–15% of people with diabetes will develop"
"a foot ulcer (35, 36), which increases their risks for infection, amputation or even premature death."
"Service users can reduce their risks, improve their healing rates and prevent amputation by"
"following advice on foot care and using orthoses, including appropriate footwear (37, 38)."
""

"Current access"
"Data on the needs and unmet needs for prosthetics and orthotics are lacking in most"
"countries; several do not have prosthetics or orthotics service facilities. When they are"
"available, facilities are usually located in capital or other large cities. The harsh reality in"
"many countries is that only 5–15% of the people who could benefit from assistive products"
"have access to them (13), including prostheses and orthoses. Even in high-income countries,"
"many people also struggle to access these services. Governments and stakeholders must"
"collect data on needs and unmet needs to serve as a basis for the development of nationwide"
"prosthetics and orthotics services and to monitor progress towards achieving the SDGs and"
"meeting their obligations under the CRPD. In the absence of proper data, it may be wrongly"
"assumed that needs are met if the demand for such services (the number of people who"
""
"xxvi"
"actively seek assistance) is low. In many countries, the need for services may be considerably"
"greater than the demand, as many people may not be aware of the services or cannot access"
"them for various practical reasons, such as affordability and distance."
""
"Benefits of prosthetics and orthotics services"
"Prosthetics and orthotics services have important benefits at various levels. Appropriate"
"provision improves the functioning of people with physical impairments or functional"
"limitations, which increases their mobility and functioning and helps them stay active and"
"productive. This, in turn, increases their independence, self-determination, participation in"
"society and well-being and helps them to lead longer, dignified lives of higher quality. For"
"many users, prostheses and orthoses allow them to gain access to education and work."
"Prosthetics and orthotics services thereby contribute to removing barriers and integrating"
"people with physical impairments or functional limitations into society and giving them equal"
"opportunities, as is their right."
""
"Prosthetics and orthotics services also generate significant economic benefits: for the users"
"(who may work and earn an income), for their families and communities (as users require"
"less care and assistance), for health services (as they help to accelerate recovery, shorten"
"hospital stays and reduce the need for frequent medical help or re-admission), for society"
"and for the country as a whole (as users become more independent and healthy, reducing"
"health and welfare costs). These benefits are particularly tangible in poor populations, where"
"prosthetics and orthotics can help people escape from extreme poverty."
""
"These services can stimulate economic growth by enabling a more productive workforce and"
"also by opening up markets and creating job opportunities for the production of prosthetic"
"and orthotic components and service delivery. They are therefore an important economic"
"investment (see 1F of Part 2). Not making such an investment has real negative effects: without"
"access to high-quality prostheses or orthoses, people with physical impairments or functional"
"limitations are at greater risk for exclusion, dependence, isolation and, ultimately, poverty, all"
"of which entail great social and economic costs for families, society and the country."
""
"Prosthetics and orthotics services as a precondition for"
"ensuring respect for human rights"
"Access to prosthetics and orthotics services is essential for people with structural or"
"functional limitations not only to achieve mobility and independence but also to enjoy"
"their human rights in the same way as others in the community (39). The CRPD states that"
"facilitating access to mobility aids, assistive devices and technologies is a State obligation"
"(8). More than 170 countries have ratified the Convention, obliging them to ensure access"
"for people in need to high-quality affordable prosthetics and orthotics services."
""
"SDG 3 is to ensure good health and well-being for everyone (12, 40). Prosthetics and orthotics"
"services play an important role in achieving this goal and also other SDGs: access to education"

"and jobs, escaping poverty and hunger, equal access to opportunities and services and"
"participation in society on an equal basis. These services are thus a precondition for achieving"
"those goals and rights for a section of the population."
""
"Challenges"
"Some challenges in developing prosthetics and orthotics services in the four core areas are"
"listed below."
""
"Area                    Challenge"
""
"• Absence of policies and national plans for prosthetics and orthotics, rehabilitation and"
"assistive technology in most countries"
"• Lack of awareness and understanding about the role, purpose and benefits of"
"prosthetics and orthotics services"
"Policy"
"• Limited funding, as these services are frequently not included in national health and"
"social insurance systems"
"• Limited data on needs for these services, making it difficult to understand the practical"
"and financial requirements of providing such services for all"
""
"• Limited availability of appropriate products in many countries"
"• High price of high-quality prostheses and orthoses. Even low-cost alternatives may be"
"perceived as expensive, particularly in low- and middle-income countries."
"Products                • Lack of national product standards in many countries, often resulting in devices that do"
"not meet acceptable safety standards"
"• Limited evidence of the effectiveness and cost–effectiveness of products, technologies"
"and working methods"
""
"• Lack of qualified personnel, reducing the quality and quantity of services. Available"
"Personnel                 personnel are usually found in large cities."
"• Limited access to schools and training opportunities for prosthetics and orthotics"
""
"• Unequal service provision. Services are frequently available only in capital and other"
"large cities and not to poor, isolated populations in rural areas."
"Provision of            • Services for the poor are usually provided by charities, some of which offer products of"
"services                  poor quality, while rich populations are frequently served by private clinics."
"• Prosthetics and orthotics services are frequently perceived as an expense rather than"
"an investment."
""
""
"The degree to which these challenges manifest themselves depends on the country, but"
"they are present in all parts of the world. It is likely that up to 90% of the people who need"
"prosthetics and orthotics services do not have access to them, as they are neither affordable"
"nor available. For many poor and marginalized populations, the reality is that these services"
"just do not exist."
""
""
""
""
"xxviii"
"The aim of this document is to improve this situation, with the goal that everyone in need,"
"everywhere, has access to prosthetics and orthotics services; “no one should be left behind”,"
"as stated in the SDGs (12). The standards in the document can help Member States to ensure"
"that people have access to high-quality services irrespective of their socioeconomic condition,"
"thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the CRPD and the SDGs. The document urges gender-"
"sensitive prosthetics and orthotics services, including more women in the workforce."

"States have the responsibility to promote the availability and use of high-quality assistive"

"users (41). As governments have the power to set the agenda and to make policy decisions,"
"they can bring together all relevant stakeholders in planning, developing and monitoring"
"prosthetics and orthotics services, with the shared goal of ensuring countrywide access."

"Introduction"
"The aim of universal health coverage is to ensure that people can access all health services,"
"including prosthetics and orthotics services, without suffering financial hardship. Sustainable"
"funding must be available for the provision of services to all in need (44). Planning and"

""
"1.2.1 Economic analysis of prosthetics and orthotics service provision"
"Rationale"
"The overall costs and economic benefits of prosthetics and orthotics service provision are"
"rarely understood by those who set policies. Information on costs is necessary for assessing"
"the full financial implications of providing a population with prostheses and orthoses. At"
"national level, costs should be analysed for five distinct areas: service establishment, training"
"of human resources, provision of services, expenses of service users and system monitoring."
"These areas cover the full cost of prosthetics and orthotics treatment, indicating the financial"
"resources necessary to assist the population. At service level, data on the full cost of each"
"of the main types of treatment and product makes it possible to set the correct prices and"
"prepare a budget."
""
"Investment in prosthetics and orthotics services generates financial returns to individuals,"
"their families, caregivers and wider society as people become healthier and need less support;"
"many are able to return to work (45). Both individuals and society accrue benefits, and the"
"financial return on investing in this sector is an important argument for service provision."
"The financial implications are best understood by comparing the economic benefits with"
"the investment. Comprehensive data on costs and benefits allow relevant ministries (such"
"as those for health, social welfare and finance) to make informed decisions for planning and"
"budgeting prosthetics and orthotics services and to recognize that the cost burden on one"
"ministry may be offset by savings in another."

"1.2.2 Funding prosthetics and orthotics services"
"Rationale"
"The funding of prosthetics and orthotics services is a challenge for most Member States."
"These services are nevertheless part of health care and rehabilitation and must be taken into"
"account or be included in health services when countries move towards universal health"
"coverage (22). As for other health services (46), people who need prosthetics and orthotics"
"services should have access to them without suffering financial hardship."
""
"The inclusion of prosthetics and orthotics services in universal health coverage requires"
"appropriate financing models and government commitment. The allocation of resources to"
"disability services has been identified as important for strengthening and improving access"
"to rehabilitation services and protecting people from burdensome expense (3, 47). Access is"
"improved by including these services in national public health and social insurance systems"
"(48). As appropriate in the local context, complementary sources of (often mixed) funding,"
"such as private health insurance and medical savings accounts, trust funds, credit unions,"
"private institutions, multinational companies, corporate social responsibility initiatives,"

"Rationale"
"Accurate data on the national need for prosthetics and orthotics are rarely available; however,"
"information on how many people require services, of what type and where they live is"

"1.4 Promotion of prosthetics and orthotics services"
"Introduction"
"The general population, and even health workers and intended service users, are often"
"unaware of the purpose and benefits of prosthetics and orthotics services. As a result,"
"many people who need the services are excluded and in poor health. Awareness-raising and"
"promotion of these services is therefore as important as for any health programme."

"Rationale"
"People who need prosthetics and orthotics services often do not know about them."
"Governments are obliged to provide accessible information about these services to people"
"with disabilities and about mobility aids, devices and assistive technologies, including"
"prostheses and orthoses (8). All stakeholders, including users and service providers, should"
"raise awareness about policy and referral. When the need, role and benefits of prosthetics"
"and orthotics services are explained, they become more visible and more accessible for new"

""
"Rationale"
"Many countries do not have national prosthetics or orthotics product standards. State"
"regulation is central to increasing access to safe, effective, high-quality prostheses and"

"Introduction"
"The capacity of prosthetics and orthotics personnel is built by structured training and"
"continuing professional development (CPD). Other health, allied health and social care"
"personnel also require knowledge of prosthetics and orthotics, as required by their position"
"in health and social care systems and their degree of involvement in prosthetics and orthotics"
"work."
""
"3.2.1 Core personnel"
"Rationale"
"Despite the expansion and development of prosthetics and orthotics training programmes"
"during the past three decades, the number of personnel required, both clinicians and"
"nonclinicians, continues to largely exceed the supply. More transformative training and"
"education are required to address the need (66). Without an increase in the number of"
"personnel, access to prosthetics and orthotics services will remain inadequate, uncertain or"
"even at crisis point."
""
"Training according to international and national standards, such as those of ISPO, equips"
"students with the minimum competence required for safe, effective practice in each"
"professional category, although more work is needed to determine the exact influence of"
"training and education on the quality of prosthetic and orthotic services (23, 67–79). ISPO"
"suggests that prosthetists and orthotists be trained at the same level as allied health"
"care professionals, associate prosthetists and orthotists at the level below that of allied"
"professionals, and technicians at the same level as health care assistants (80). Training at"
"different levels ensures that service needs are met in all settings at all levels of resources,"
"including decentralized services. Planning training as a continuum allows professionals to"

"3.2.2 Other personnel"
"Rationale"
"All health care and allied health and social care personnel should have a basic understanding"
"of prosthetics and orthotics, so that they can identify and refer people for treatment and"

"Opportunities for CPD are severely lacking, especially in poorer settings (73–78, 90–92). CPD"
"provides prosthetics and orthotics personnel with a variety of learning opportunities and"
"experiences to maintain and develop their practice and ensure that they can continue to work"
"effectively and safely in an evolving field. CPD is fundamental to securing and improving the"
"quality of services provided by professionals at all levels. It also allows experienced personnel"
"who have received little formal training to update their knowledge and practical skills,"

""
"Rationale"
"In many countries, the workforce for prosthetics and orthotics services is not planned, so"
"that the right personnel may not be in the right locations. Workforce planning involves"
"determining the demand for personnel, comparing it with the existing supply and assessing"
"training needs. Evaluating the availability of all the disciplines involved in prosthetics and"

"3.4 Professional regulation and recognition"
"Introduction"
"Regulations are required for health professionals, including prosthetists and orthotists, in"
"order to enforce accountability of conduct and practice and reduce the risk of users for harm."
"Professional recognition gives adequate importance to prosthetics and orthotics personnel"
"and the services they provide and is linked to regulation. Recognition is a precondition for"
"regulation, and regulation further increases recognition."
""
"Rationale"
"Many countries do not have professional regulation or recognition of prosthetists and"
"orthotists, placing service users at risk for malpractice and poor-quality services. The"
"introduction of professional regulations protects service users from these risks. The"
"regulations should define the minimum levels of education and experience required for these"
"professionals to practise and the permitted scope of work. State regulation of prosthetics"

""
"Recognition of prosthetics and orthotics clinicians as health professionals with distinct"
"professional titles and profiles firmly establishes these services in the national health service"
"and increases the motivation, retention and professional development of personnel, which"
"in turn enhances service provision. Recognition implies that these clinicians have a clear"

"Introduction"
"In order to reach all people in need, prosthetics and orthotics services are best planned"
"and delivered through a system tailored to the needs, expectations and distribution of"
"the population, with careful consideration of the resources available. Different services"
"are needed at primary, secondary and tertiary levels, with standardized referral pathways."
"Mainstreaming prosthetics and orthotics services into national health care programmes"
"contributes to attaining the goal of universal health coverage. Special considerations are"
"required when delivering services in disaster contexts."
""
"4.2.1 Inclusive service delivery"
"Rationale"
"Access to prosthetics and orthotics services is inequitable in many countries, whereas the"
"principle of equal access to health services (11) is also applicable to these services. This implies"
"that services are available for every person’s needs and choices, without discrimination and"
"regardless of the person’s health, gender, age or socioeconomic circumstances."
""
"Prosthetics and orthotics services provide treatment for a range of health conditions (100)."
"They are related to other health services, such as medical, surgical, rehabilitation and therapy,"
"with which they frequently interact and may share resources and outcomes. The inclusion of"
"prosthetics and orthotics services in the health sector contributes to inclusive health services"
"for all, including for people with disabilities and people with chronic health conditions."

""
"Application of a three-tier system with differentiated services at primary, secondary and"
"tertiary levels of the health care system is likely to improve access to prosthetics and orthotics"
"services (26) (Fig. 6). By offering a realistic range of treatments at each service level, the range"
"of services will be as wide as possible and can be provided close to people’s communities,"
"including in rural areas (101). In order to respond to the different needs of users, there should"
"be established links and standardized referral pathways among levels of service. Thus,"
"common, simple cases can be treated at primary level, while rare and complicated cases"
"can be referred to secondary and tertiary levels, where the personnel are more specialized."

"When prosthetics and orthotics services are included in national health care programmes,"
"users can access important resources at the primary level. Inclusion of a limited range of"
"prosthetics and orthotics services in primary health care (as decided at tertiary and secondary"
"levels) extends the geographical reach of these services, so that more people can be assisted"
"(20, 101). This approach is of mutual benefit for both prosthetics and orthotics services and"
"the health care system. Many treatments require a joint approach to be successful, including"
"early detection of impairments followed by early intervention. A health care programme that"
"includes prosthetics and orthotics can make this possible. Integration of these services into"
"national health programmes requires training of personnel, particularly in primary health care."

"4.3 Service units"
"Introduction"
"A prosthetics and orthotics unit provides a space for professionals and users to interact and"
"for the design, manufacture, customization, fitting, delivery and maintenance of prostheses"
"and orthoses. The unit should be properly planned, appropriately equipped and offer a safe"
"environment for users and personnel so that all processes are performed effectively and"
"efficiently."
""
"4.3.1 Settings"
"Rationale"
"Prosthetics and orthotics service units that are isolated from mainstream health care"
"and rehabilitation services tend to have difficulty in developing and remaining efficient."
"The establishment of service units in health facilities, including those for rehabilitation,"
"strengthens contacts with health professionals, facilitates multidisciplinary work, improves"
"referral, generally speeds up treatment and improves overall outcomes."
""
"Service units for the provision of a broader range of assistive devices (from prostheses and"
"orthoses to other mobility devices, including wheelchairs and crutches, and other assistive"
"products, such as devices for vision and hearing) may be a cost-effective way of providing"
"comprehensive services to large user groups. This may be particularly important for older"
"populations, who often require several types of assistive product."
""
"NO. STANDARD"
"Prosthetics and orthotics service units should be established within or closely linked to health and"
"45"
"rehabilitation service facilities, such as district and referral hospitals."
"The possibility of integrating prosthetics and orthotics service units into broader services for assistive"
"46"
"products should be considered and explored."
"Related topic in the implementation manual:"

""
"4.3.2 Infrastructure"
"Rationale"
"By carefully designing prosthetics and orthotics units and adapting the layout and size to"
"the intended workload and the types of services to be provided, individual needs can be met"
"in a cost–effective, professional manner, and the unit can effectively contribute to meeting"
"needs in the area (102)."
""
"An accessible, barrier-free environment that provides privacy for every individual during"
"service is essential. Ensuring that girls, boys, women and men can be treated separately"
"makes services accessible to all, irrespective of gender or age."

"4.4 Service unit processes"
"Introduction"
"Appropriate processes for service delivery and service unit management ensure that all work"
"is carried out systematically, effectively, efficiently and safely."
""
"4.4.1 The service delivery process"
"Rationale"
"Inadequate clarity about the details of prosthetics and orthotics service provision – from"
"referral throughout the delivery process – can lead to misunderstandings and inefficiency."
""
"Referral is strengthened by informing and training partners – especially primary health care"
"personnel, community health workers, community rehabilitation personnel, social workers"
"and user groups – in identifying people who need prosthetics and orthotics services and"
"referring them to the service unit."
""
"After identification and referral, the delivery of prosthetics and orthotics services consists of"
"assessment, fabrication and fitting, user training and product delivery and follow-up (Fig. 7)."

"The establishment of documented procedures and protocols for these four steps helps to"
"ensure that services are consistent, effective and efficient in all phases of delivery. Their"
"adequacy is further reinforced by application of minimum quality requirements based on"
"the best available evidence and national and international standards."
""
"Assessment: Every user of prosthetics and orthotics services should be assessed individually"
"by a professional with appropriate knowledge and skills or, when possible and required, by a"
"multidisciplinary team. The assessment should be holistic, taking into account the lifestyle,"
"living environment and physical condition of the user. Active involvement of service users and"
"caregivers in assessment, goal-setting and planning treatment ensures that the treatment"
"will be the most appropriate for the user."

"The provision of peer support in service delivery increases the motivation of users, may speed"
"up treatment and contributes to improved outcomes."
""
"Fabrication and fitting: Careful adherence to the manufacturer’s or supplier’s instructions"
"on the use of components and materials can ensure that the full potential of products is"
"used and hazards for users and personnel are minimized. When new products are used,"
"prosthetics and orthotics professionals should be trained in their application to ensure"
"seamless introduction, minimize technical problems and protect users."
""
"User training: Training, including physiotherapy and occupational therapy, is critical to"
"the outcome of prosthetics and orthotics treatment and helps to maximize the benefits of"
"products (65, 84, 103). Users who have insufficient training may be at risk for injury. Active"
"involvement of family members and caregivers in training is critical for users who depend"
"on regular support in their daily activities."

"When Kirsti was 16 years old, she broke her back in a"
"car accident and became totally paralysed from the waist"
"down. Using an orthosis has become a natural part of"
"her “clothing” because it reduces the pain in her spine"
"and improves her balance. It has allowed her to study"
"pharmacy and to have active leisure time."
"Kirsti has always done sports; a highlight was winning"
"a gold medal for cross-country skiing at the Winter"
"Olympics in 1994. Now, she skis in her spare time"
"in winter and often goes biking or canoeing with her"
"husband in the summer."
"A normal day starts with Kirsti leaving for work as a"
"clinical pharmacist, which is an exciting job that she"
"thoroughly enjoys. Every day she gets the opportunity"
"to help determine the optimal drug therapy for patients"
"in prisons, hospitals and nursing homes. After work,"
"she usually goes shopping and then goes home to make"
"dinner with her family."
"Kirsti says, “I live a completely normal life like everyone else"
"in Norway. The only difference is that I use a wheelchair"
"instead of walking.”"

"The way forward"
"Despite adoption of the CRPD in 2006, today, only 1 in 10 people in need have access to"
"assistive products, including prostheses and orthoses, because of high costs, poor awareness"
"and a general lack of services, trained personnel, policy and adequate financing. When the"
"services are available, the quality of the prostheses or orthoses is not always acceptable,"
"adding more challenges for people with physical impairments or functional limitations."
""
"Prostheses and orthoses should be available to all who need them. Their provision positively"
"affects the health and well-being of users and their families and has broader socioeconomic"
"benefits. These devices help people to become more active and to live healthy, productive,"
"independent, dignified lives and to participate in education, the labour market and social life."
""
"The set of 60 global standards presented in this document will assist Member States in setting"
"up, improving and transforming national prosthetics and orthotics services, thereby contributing"
"to improving access to high-quality, affordable services globally. This is a decisive step towards"
"strengthening universal health coverage and making sure that “no one is left behind”."
""
"Strategy for implementing the standards"
"Implementing the standards should involve various stakeholders, including:"
"• service users, families and caregivers;"
"• user groups and disabled people’s organizations;"
"• national, regional and local governments;"
"• civil society organizations;"
"• prosthetics and orthotics service providers (both public and private);"
"• health service providers, including those providing rehabilitation;"
"• training and academic institutions;"
"• professional associations;"
"• manufacturers and suppliers of components, materials and consumables;"
"• international organizations and agencies; and"
"• funding agencies."
""
"The following steps are suggested for setting up or improving a national prosthetics and"
"orthotics service and implementing the standards. More detailed guidance is provided in"
"Part 2 of this document."
"• Develop a national prosthetics and orthotics policy and a 5–10-year specific, measurable,"
"achievable, realistic and timely (“SMART”) action plan."

"• Set up a nationwide prosthetics and orthotics service, integrated within the health system,"
"to attain universal health coverage, the SDGs and related articles of the CRPD (articles 4,"
"19, 20, 26 and 32)."
"• Encourage public–private partnerships and financing to ensure that everyone in need,"
"everywhere, has access to high-quality prostheses and orthoses."
"• Ensure health or welfare insurance coverage to reimburse the cost of prostheses and"
"orthoses."
"• Establish a workforce and deploy them at secondary and tertiary levels, as a minimum."
"• Ensure the availability of high-quality products, components and materials, and waive"
"import duty and taxes on items that are not available in the country."
"• Involve prosthetics and orthotics users, their caregivers and organizations in planning,"
"implementing, monitoring and evaluating the plan."
"• Audit prosthetics and orthotics standards, and assess needs periodically."
""
"While the WHO standards can serve as a global guide, Member States should adapt them"
"to their contexts, giving priority to standards that must be in place to safeguard user rights,"
"safety, quality and performance. In countries with limited resources, some of the priorities,"
"particularly those that require technical assistance, technology transfer or capacity-building,"
"could be covered by the international cooperation framework defined in Article 32 of the"
"CRPD."
""
"Requirements for data and evidence"
"This document is based on the best available evidence; however, data and evidence on"
"prosthetics and orthotics are lacking. Research and studies are required to obtain better"
"data and to identify good examples of these services, including governance, sector planning,"
"monitoring and financing. The following thematic areas are suggested as major global"
"priorities for prosthetics and orthotics research:"
"• effects, costs and economic impact of prosthetics and orthotics services;"
"• policies, systems, service provision models and best practices;"
"• high-quality, affordable products;"
"• human resources for the provision of prosthetics and orthotics services; and"
